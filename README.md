## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I have experience as a **Trainee / Junior Django Developer**, where I worked on a real production project.
My main focus is backend development using **Python and Django**, writing clean and maintainable code, fixing bugs, and implementing new features according to requirements.

Before transitioning into IT, I worked in retail for many years and held a managerial position. This background helped me develop strong responsibility, communication, and process organization skills, which I successfully apply in development teams.
